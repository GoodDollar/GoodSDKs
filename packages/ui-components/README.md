# Claim Button Web Component

The `claim-button` web component provides a simple and interactive way for users to claim Universal Basic Income (UBI) in the form of GoodDollars (G$) on supported blockchain networks (Celo and Fuse). It integrates with the GoodDollar ecosystem to manage wallet connections, eligibility checks, and token claims, offering a seamless experience for users within any web application.

## What It Does

The `claim-button` enables users to:

- Connect their cryptocurrency wallet (via Reown AppKit).
- Check their eligibility to claim G$ tokens based on the GoodDollar protocol.
- If this is a new user, they will be guided through our [Face-Verification flow](https://docs.gooddollar.org/about-the-protocol/sybil-resistance)
- Claim their UBI with a single click, handling all blockchain transactions.
- View their G$ token balance.
- See a countdown timer until their next claim if theyâ€™ve already claimed for the current period.
- Switch between supported chains (Celo and Fuse) if entitlements are available on another network.

## How to Use It

You can integrate the `claim-button` into your project in two ways:

### Option 1: Using the Standalone Script

Can be used in any website, for a quick setup:

1. **Download the Script**: Download the `claim-button.global.js` file from the project releases or build it from the source.
2. **Include in HTML**: Add the script to your HTML file.
3. **Add the Component**: Use the `<claim-button>` tag where you want it to appear.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Claim Button Example</title>
    <script src="path/to/claim-button.global.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <claim-button environment="production"></claim-button>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Option 2: Using ESM Modules

For projects with a modern JavaScript setup:

1. **Install the Package**: Add the `@goodsdks/ui-components` package to your project.
   ```bash
   npm install @goodsdks/ui-components
   ```
2. **Import the Component**: Import it in your JavaScript or TypeScript file.
   ```javascript
   import "@goodsdks/ui-components"
   ```
3. **Use in HTML**: Place the `<claim-button>` tag in your template.
   ```html
   <claim-button environment="production"></claim-button>
   ```

## Configurable Options

Customize the `claim-button` using these properties:

- **`environment`**: Defines the environment for contract interactions.
  - Values: `"production"`, `"staging"`, or `"development"`.
  - Default: `"development"`.
  - Example:
    ```html
    <claim-button environment="production"></claim-button>
    ```

## Additional Notes

- **Dependencies**: The component uses `@reown/appkit` for wallet connections, `@goodsdks/citizen-sdk` for claim logic, `viem` for blockchain interactions, and `lit` for the reactive UI.
- **Supported Chains**: Works on Celo and Fuse networks.
- **Feedback**: Displays loading states, success messages, errors, and a countdown timer as needed.
